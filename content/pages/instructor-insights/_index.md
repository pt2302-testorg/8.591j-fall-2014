## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *8.591J Systems Biology* as it was taught by Jeff Gore, Latham Family Career Development Assistant Professor of Physics in Fall 2014.

This course provides an introduction to cellular and population-level systems biology with an emphasis on synthetic biology, modeling of genetic networks, cell-cell interactions, and evolutionary dynamics.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Understand how cells respond to the environment and process information in order to divide.
- Explore how interactions between genes influence the decision-making of cells.
- Examine how interactions between individuals shape how the population behaves in response to environmental pressures.

## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

- [*Introductory Biology 7.012*](/courses/7-012-introduction-to-biology-fall-2004)      
    (Biology GIR ![](/images/educator/icon-question-gir.png))
- [*Differential Equations 18.03*](/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011)
- [*Probability 18.05*](/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014)

In addition, each weekly problem had a computational problem, so prior experience with a computational package such as MATLAB®, Mathematica®, or Python was expected. The “officially supported” package was be Python (sample code, etc), but students were able to do problems in any language.

### Requirements Satisfied

GIR Science Core, Biology

### Offered

Every fall semester

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class/Lecture

- Met 2 times per week for 90 minute sessions; 24 sessions total, mandatory attendance.
- In-class activities included multiple-choice concept questions ![](/images/educator/icon-question-conq.png) and collaborative learning.

### Out of Class

- Students were required to submit answers to the pre-class reading questions online, prior to each lecture.
- Students completed weekly problem sets for the course.
