What is a network motif?

What controls do the authors use to make sure that oscillation are not just an artifact of GFP expression?

Of the six potential stable states of a reaction-diffusion system with two interacting molecules, which stable state does not yet have a concrete biological example?

Gierer and Meinhardt showed that "a short-range positive feedback with a long-range negative feedback" is the basic requirement for Turing pattern formation. In the context of an activator-inhibitor system, what does this requirement mean in terms of the diffusion coefficients of the activator and the inhibitor?

Why is the model with nonlinear degradation rate considered a more robust mechanism for developmental patterning?

Describe the stages in the evolutionary cycle of the multi-clone model. What is the source of the increased phase lag?

Is predator evolution necessary for phase delays, and why?

The idea of predator-prey interactions was originally formulated by Volterra to explain the observation that during wartime, when fishing activities were reduced, the relative abundance of predatory fish increased. Please explain his arguments.

For sustained predator-prey oscillations, we define the phase lag as the time between the peak in prey abundance and the peak in predator abundance. What is the typical phase lag?
